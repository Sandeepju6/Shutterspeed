              <p>The difference in image quality between the two is narrowing and
 technological advancements are pushing many in favour of mirrorless cameras rather
 than the traditional DSLRs. We've compared them to help you understand the differences 
and make a choice between the two.
Digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) and mirrorless (often referred to as compact system) cameras
 are both interchangeable lens cameras, with features for more advanced photography.
 There are a range of models available for each, from those aimed at entry-level photography
 enthusiasts to professionals. Both cameras typically have big sensors, allowing them to let
 in more light and essentially capture more detail than a standard digital camera. The main
 difference between the two is that DSLR cameras have a reflex mirror inside them, which bounces
 light up into the optical viewfinder. With a mirrorless camera, light goes directly into the image
 sensor and they will have an electronic viewfinder or LCD monitor to display a preview of the image.

Despite mirrorless cameras becoming more widely available and closer to DSLR cameras in quality,
 there are pros and cons to both.  With an ‘old-school’ DSLR, there tend to be perks,
 which is most noticeably the superior speed when autofocusing or tracking subjects – although this is changing.
  Traditionally DSLR cameras use ‘phase detection’ autofocus modules in the body of the camera, which make autofocusing
 and tracking subjects fast.  Mirrorless cameras rely on sensor-based autofocus, which analyses the maximum contrast 
between pixels on the camera’s sensor. When the contrast is highest, the subject is in focus. This method is traditionally slower
 and also tends to struggle with moving subjects, as it doesn’t involve measuring distance, just the level of contrast.
  However, advancements in high-end cameras will see ‘hybrid’ autofocus systems featuring in the best mirrorless cameras,
 narrowing the gap between the autofocusing speeds of DSLR and mirrorless cameras. That said – there is a reason why DSLR
 cameras continue to be manufactured and stay the favourite of both amateurs and professionals.
