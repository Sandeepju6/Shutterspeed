              <p>Sigma's newest full-frame lens is a macro, 
                  built for mirrorless systems. The 105mm F2.8
                   DG DN Macro Art comes in a classic focal length
                    for macro work, and focuses close enough to project
                     subjects onto your camera's sensor at life-size—a 
                     boon for getting the most detail out of really tiny
                      subjects. The lens sports a fresh optical formula,
                       designed specifically for mirrorless systems.
                        It's being sold it in two versions—E-mount for Sony
                         and L-mount for cameras from Leica, Panasonic, 
                         and Sigma. As you'd expect, the 105mm Macro is 
                         protected from dust and splashes, just like most 
                         full-frame camera systems. It doesn't include 
                         stabilization, but many compatible cameras offer 
                         in-body stabilization, and macro work is often done 
                         with the aid of a tripod. <br><br> It's an important lens for 
                         L-mount owners—it's the first purpose built macro lens 
                         for the system—and E-mount owners can look at it as a 
                         more affordable alternative to the Sony FE 90mm Macro. 
                         If you're an L-mount owner, you can pair a compatible 
                         teleconverter to extend the focal length and net photos 
                         with larger than life-size magnification. Other features 
                         include hypersonic autofocus motors—macro lenses aren't
                          well known as fast focusers, but Sigma promises quiet, 
                          quick focus here. There's a focus limiter switch too, 
                          so you can prevent the lens from looking for distant 
                          subjects when photographing close-up, or vice versa, 
                          as well as an aperture ring that can operate with or 
                          without detent clicks. We've not yet had a chance to 
                          test the 105mm Macro F2.8 DG DN Macro Art, but Sigma 
                          tells us to expect the lens soon—it's going to go on 
                          sale to customers in October, with a $799 asking price, 
                          very reasonable when compared with similar options for other 
                          camera systems.</p>
