              <p>The Sony a7R Mark III is the company's latest high-resolution
 full frame mirrorless camera. Much like Nikon's recent D850, it's one that combines
 this resolution with high speed and fast autofocus capabilities to a degree we've not previously seen.

Like its predecessor, the Mark III is built around a 42MP BSI CMOS sensor,
 but unlike the a7R II, it can shoot at ten frames per second.

Essentially it can be seen as an a7R II that inherits many of the lessons
 learned from the company's pro-sports model, the a9. This means faster processing,
 improved autofocus, improved handling and ergonomics, as well as the adoption of a much larger battery.
 While some of the individual changes are subtle, they very quickly combine to produce a hugely capable and highly useable camera.
Sony says the a7R III is based around the same 42MP back side illuminated CMOS sensor as its immediate predecessor,
 so doesn't gain the full speed advantages of the a9's Stacked CMOS chip (in terms of AF performance, continuous
 shooting rate or reduced rolling shutter in video and electronic shutter mode). However, the adoption of the processing systems,
 algorithms and refinements introduced on the a9 all have their benefits.
For our tests we recruited the help of a kenshi (swordsman) running through a series of kenjutsu patterns which combined movement
 across the frame and towards the camera. We wanted to find out how well the AF system could track the mask on the helmet and keep
 that sharp as the key point of focus through these fast and complex movements. 

In fact the A7R III kept up pretty well, though each AF zone had its pros and cons. The Flexible Spot mode was best for
 keeping the mask in focus, provided we kept the AF point in the right place – but that wasn't easy with sudden lateral
 movements and sword strokes in front of the mask. 

Using a wider focus zone and focus tracking took the pressure off accurate focus point positioning and allowed a steadier
 camera position, but if the subject left the zone the AF defaulted to the background, and in some instances the camera lost focus
 completely for a frame or two for no obvious reason.

Photographing moving subjects demands a good deal of skill, anticipation and practice on the part of the photographer.
 The A7R III's AF system responded well with a really tough subject, with a good hit rate of in-focus shots, but confirmed that skill,
 practice and luck are part of the equation too. 
When it launched in 2017, the Sony A7R III was unrivaled in its power and versatility. However, even though the market has caught up with
 its specs, it remains a powerhouse to this day, with near-medium format resolution packed into a sleek, stabilized body. Indeed,
 unless you REALLY need the 61MP sensor, the A7R III might be a much wiser purchase than the A7R IV – and it certainly comes with
 a much more appealing price tag.
